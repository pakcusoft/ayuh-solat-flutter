- Tap "Select Zone" button (was previously a dropdown)
- Opens the dedicated searchable zone selection screen

### 2. **Searching for Zones**
```
Single-word search examples:
- "KL" → finds Kuala Lumpur zones
- "Selangor" → finds all Selangor zones
- "WLY01" → finds specific Kuala Lumpur zone
- "Sabah" → finds all Sabah zones

Multi-word search examples:
- "Alor Setar" → finds "Kota Setar" (KDH01) 
- "Johor Bahru" → finds JHR02 zone
- "Kuala Lumpur" → finds WLY01 zone
- "Port Dickson" → finds NGS03 zone
- "Kota Kinabalu" → finds SBH07 zone
```

### 3. **Zone Selection Process**
- Browse all available zones or use search
- Tap on desired zone to select it
- Automatically returns to settings with zone saved
- Confirmation message shows the selected zone

## Technical Implementation

### **Advanced Multi-Word Search Algorithm**
- **Case-insensitive search**: Works regardless of uppercase/lowercase input
- **Multi-word support**: Automatically splits search queries on spaces
- **Flexible matching**: Finds zones where ANY search word matches ANY part of zone code or description
- **Smart relevance ranking**: Results ordered by relevance with exact matches first
- **Real-time filtering**: Results update immediately as user types
- **No network requests**: All searching happens locally for instant results

### **Search Matching Examples**
```
"Alor Setar" → splits into ["alor", "setar"]
✓ Matches "Kota Setar, Kubang Pasu, Pokok Sena" (contains "setar")
✓ Would also match any zone containing "alor"

"Kuala Terengganu" → splits into ["kuala", "terengganu"]
✓ Matches TRG01: "Kuala Terengganu, Marang, Kuala Nerus"
✓ Would also match zones with just "kuala" or just "terengganu"

"JHR Bahru" → splits into ["jhr", "bahru"]
✓ Matches JHR02 (contains "jhr" in zone code)
✓ Also matches any zone with "bahru" in description
```

### **Relevance Scoring System**
Results are automatically sorted by relevance:
1. **Exact zone code match** (highest priority)
2. **Zone code starts with search word**
3. **Zone code contains search word**
4. **Location name starts with search word**
5. **Location name contains search word** (lowest priority)

### **Performance Optimizations**
- Efficient filtering using Dart's native `where` method
- Minimal rebuilds using proper state management
- Smooth scrolling with ListView.builder
- Optimized for 100+ zones without performance issues

### **Zone Data Structure**
The app includes all official JAKIM e-Solat zones:
- **14 Malaysian states/territories** covered
- **100+ specific zones** with detailed descriptions
